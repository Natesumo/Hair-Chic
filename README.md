This is a fake site for my mother's hair salon, Hair Chic Design Studio.

This project is meant to act as a landing page for potential customers, giving them an idea of what services are offered, and what make Hair Chic stand out from other salons.

HTML, CSS (Flexbox & Grid).

In the future I would like to add some javascript/bootstrap functonality to this site. 
Some animations upon hover would really make the site appear more professionally done.
Implementing formspree.io to receive submissions from users.
